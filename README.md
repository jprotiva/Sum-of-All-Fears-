Sum of all Fears App

This app is designed to to be the answer to a coding challenge. The challenge is stated as such “Given a list of numbers and a number K, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to K. Example: given [10, 15, 3, 7] and K of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17. The basic challenge is to write a program that uses a hard-coded array of [10, 15, 3, 7] and allows the user to enter a value for K before running the algorithm and returning true or false.” (Josh Scott)The challenge had a more experienced add on which was “Allow the user to enter in their own values for both the Array and K before running the algorithm and returning true or false.”(Josh Scott). My sum of all fears app accomplished the more experience version of this challenge.
